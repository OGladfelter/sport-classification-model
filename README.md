# Sport Classification Model

Our primary objective is to develop a supervised classification model that accurately predicts the sport type (bike ride, run, walk, etc) of a given activity based on its recorded metrics.

GPS watches record an athlete’s location, distance, time spent moving, elevation gain, and more. However, the sport type is not programmatically set; before starting their workouts, athletes using GPS watches must first manually select from a list of sports on the device. The need to manually select a sport type often leads to user error: 

Our classification model will accurately classify the sport type of workouts - primarily Ride, Run, Walk, Hike, and an “Other” bucket. The model will leverage features such as distance, moving time, elapsed time, elevation gain, average speed, start date, start coordinates, and GPS traces. 

An additional stretch goal is to distinguish between standard bicycle rides and e-bike rides. Distinguishing e-bike rides from standard bicycle rides is a growing concern on platforms like Strava, where e-bike users may unfairly claim leaderboard positions. A robust classification model can flag suspicious activities for review.

# Data dictionary 
- id - unique ID for workout
- user_id - unique ID for athlete who did the workout
- sport_type - sport for the workout (~40 unique)
- sport_type_grouped - groups workouts into main groups
- speed_mph - miles / elapsed time in hours
- distance - distance in meters
- miles - distance in miles
- kilometers - distance in kilometers
- moving_time - seconds of active moving time (pauses for red light, water break, etc)
- elapsed_time - total seconds for entire workout
- moving_minutes - minutes of active moving time
- elapsed_minutes - minutes for entire workout
- moving_time_per - moving_minutes / elapsed_minutes
- total_elevation_gain - meters of climbing
- meters_per_km - avg meters of climbing per kilometer
feet_per_mile - avg feet of climbing per mile (for the Americans lol)
- commute - boolean flag is user marked the activity as a 'commute' (like when Oliver bikes to class)
- manual - flag for if the workout was generated by a tracking device or if user manually entered the details
- has_gear - boolean for if user indicated which shoes/bike they used for the workout
- suffer_score - Strava metric used to describe how tough the workout is; function of heart rate and total time
- kudos_count - how many "likes" the workout received on Strava
- device_name - name used to record the workout
- start_date - date of workout
- hour - hour of workout (start)
- day_part - morning vs afternoon vs evening vs night (start)
- month - month of workout
- dayofweek - day of week of workout
- is_weekend - boolean for if dayofweek == Saturday or Sunday
- is_northern_hemisphere - start_lat > 0
- num_turns - number of turns in the GPS trace
- turns_per_mile - num_turns / miles
- wobble - how wiggly vs straight the trace is (ignoring turns)
- sprawl - distance (in miles) from most northwest vs most southeast points in the trace
